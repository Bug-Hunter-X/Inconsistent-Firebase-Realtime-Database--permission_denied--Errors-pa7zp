To address the inconsistent `permission_denied` errors, we can implement the following strategies:

1. **Detailed Logging:** Add comprehensive logging to track read and write attempts, including the data being accessed and the security rules that are evaluated. This can help pinpoint the exact rule causing the denial, which is often obfuscated by the generic error message. Example:
```javascript
firebase.database().ref('/your/data/path').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log('Attempting to read data:', snapshot.key);
  console.log('Security rules evaluation:', snapshot.val()); // Log the evaluated rules if possible
  // ... rest of your code
});
```

2. **Rule Simplification:** Break down complex security rules into smaller, more manageable components. Testing each rule individually can greatly simplify the debugging process and isolate the root cause of the problem.  Avoid deeply nested rules if possible.

3. **Simulate Access:** Create a test environment to carefully simulate user access scenarios. Using test accounts with specific permissions can help systematically identify and fix access problems.

4. **Check for Rule Caching:** Ensure that your Firebase Realtime Database rules are properly cached and that stale rules are not causing inconsistent behaviors.  If necessary, trigger a cache refresh.

5. **Data Validation:** Implement thorough data validation on both the client and server sides to ensure data consistency and prevent unexpected errors. This can prevent errors arising from incorrect data structures or values.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively track down and resolve this challenging debugging problem in your Firebase applications.
