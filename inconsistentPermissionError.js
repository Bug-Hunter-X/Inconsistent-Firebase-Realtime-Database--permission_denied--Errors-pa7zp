The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `Error: permission_denied` error even when the security rules seem correctly configured. This often happens inconsistently, making debugging difficult.  The error doesn't always provide specific details about which rule is failing.  This is especially troublesome when using complex nested data structures or intricate security rules.
