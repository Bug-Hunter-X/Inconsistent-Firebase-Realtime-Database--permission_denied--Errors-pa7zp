# Inconsistent Firebase Realtime Database `permission_denied` Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with Firebase Realtime Database security rules: inconsistent `permission_denied` errors.  Even with seemingly correct rules, the database may intermittently deny access, offering little insight into the cause.

The example code includes a scenario where access is expected, yet the error occurs sporadically.  The solution provides strategies for debugging and resolving this type of problem, including detailed logging and rule simplification techniques.  This issue highlights the need for robust logging and careful rule design when working with Firebase Realtime Database.
